//something about a town and flooding it by removing the dam, ould be a cool ethical thing where flooding saves the beavers but murders a great number of people
//extension of that, start of the game you spawn next to a huge circular river and you can't see the inside but you know your goal is to get over it
//turns out it's the moat for  atown and you complete the mission but flood the town. then you can either rule the ruined town as beaver god or help rebuild.
